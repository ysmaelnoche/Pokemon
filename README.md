In the plain JavaScript version, everything is straightforward and easy to set up. You have three main files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file contains a form where users can type in a Pokémon’s name and a section to display the details. The JavaScript file handles all the logic—like fetching data from the Pokémon API when the form is submitted and updating the webpage using innerHTML. The CSS file styles the page to make it look nice. This approach is simple, doesn’t require any extra tools, and is great for small projects or if you’re just starting out. However, as the project grows, managing everything in one JavaScript file can get messy.

On the other hand, the React.js version is more organized and scalable. Instead of directly changing the HTML, React uses components to manage the user interface. For example, the main logic lives in App.js, and React’s useState helps keep track of the Pokémon data and any errors that might occur. When the data changes, React automatically updates the webpage, making it faster and more efficient. This modular structure makes it easier to add new features or reuse components in larger projects. However, setting up a React project requires more files and some knowledge of how React works, which might feel overwhelming if you’re new to JavaScript frameworks.

So, which one should you choose? If you’re looking for something quick, simple, and easy to understand, the plain JavaScript version is the way to go. It’s perfect for small projects or if you want to avoid extra setup. But if you’re working on a bigger project or want a more structured and scalable approach, React.js is the better choice. While plain JavaScript works well for smaller tasks, React shines when you need to build something more complex and maintainable.
